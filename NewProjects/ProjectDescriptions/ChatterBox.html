                                    <p>With my eyes set upon the idea of a chat application, I began with lots of research. I knew I needed some sort of networking API. As I became familiar with the idea of sockets, I came across a library to use for my project (that also was compatable with CPP). </p>
                                    <p>
                                    <a href = "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/windows-sockets-start-page-2">Winsock</a> is Microsoft's Windows Socket API. "Winsock enables programmers to create advanced Internet, intranet, and other network-capable applications to transmit application data across the wire, independent of the network protocol being used." With Winsock, I would use TCP  socket connections rather than UDP to ensure data is sent/received.</p>
                                    <p> I first made the project using standard terminal, but later transitioned into a <a href = "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/dotnet/dotnet-programming-with-cpp-cli-visual-cpp?view=msvc-160">.NET framwork</a> via Visual Basic's  C++/CLI support.
                                    </p>
                                    
                                    <h1 >Project</h1>
                                    <hr style="margin: 0 15px 0 15px; border-top: 2px solid aqua;">
                                    <p>
                                    I first implemented a basic server/client connection to send data through a single pair of socekts. The client would send data (a message) to the server and the server would echo this message back to the client. As I optimized this, I began adding more clients to the server. Now Client 1 could send a message to the server, and the message would echo back to both of the clients. However, this process was syncronous, a.k.a. cyclic: the clients had to send messages in order rather than whenever they want. I would need to make the server asynchronous.</p>

                                    <p>To do this we would need more threads: multi-threading. With this, we can check if any client is trying to send data, rather than just one. After implementing multi-threading and successful multi-client communication, it was time to make the program pretty.</p>
                                    <p>Visual Studio/Basic's .Net/clr framework does not support some the processes a standard environment could. To get around this, one would have to use System processes. After transfering my project to the new environment and added visuals, it was now complete.</p>
